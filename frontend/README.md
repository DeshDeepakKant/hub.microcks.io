This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.2.

## Development server

Start the hub.microcks.io backend server as described in the [backend README](../server/README.md).

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
